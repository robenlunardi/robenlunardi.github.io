### Welcome!

Welcome to my personal homepage! I am currently working as an associate professor at [IFRS](https://ifrs.edu.br) - [Campus Restinga](https://ifrs.edu.br/restinga). My research interests are in Cybersecurity, Computer Networks, IoT, and Educational Robotics.

### Education and Previous Experience

Previously, from 2017 to 2021, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS). During my PhD, I participated in the research internship program promoted by the Australian Academy of Science (Australia-Americas PhD Research Internship Program) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney/Australia 🇦🇺🦘🐨 in 2018, with the supervision of Professor Salil Kanhere. I also participated in a doctoral internship (Sandwich Doctorate) at Newcastle University (Newcastle Upon Tyne / United Kingdom 🇬🇧), from October 2019 to March 2020, under the supervision of Professor Aad van Moorsel.
From 2008 to 2010, I obtained an MSc in Computing from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), where I participated in a research project focused on Change Management in IT Infrastructure funded by Hewlett-Packard (HP) R & D Brazil. 
During my BSc (from 2004 to 2007), I performed an internship and participated in scientific projects at the Southern Regional Center for Space Research (CRSPE) of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). 

I have experience in Computer Science, with an emphasis on Systems Security, Computer Networks and Automation, acting on the following subjects: Blockchains, Information Security, Computer Network Management, Software Defined Networks, Infrastructure Change Management IT, IoT and Educational Robotics. I am member of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and member of the IEEE.


### Current Research and Projects

I like to be active and engage in interesting projects both in parternership with Academy and with Industry.  I am coordinating different research projects in cybersecurity, more specifically in Blockchain, distributed applications security evaluation, and  pentesting. In 2022, I participated in a project to evaluate different techniques to introduce computational thinking to students in elementary schools.. In 2022, I participated in a project to evaluate different techniques to introduce computational thinking to students in elementary schools. During 2018–2020, I participated in three different research projects about blockchain with companies: with a financial institution and with two software development companies. These projects helped to understand important aspects that should be considered for the adoption of blockchains in real scenarios.  I was also the coordinator of the undergraduate program in Systems' Analisys and Development at IFRS from 2013-2016. Previoulsy, I coordinated, participated and lead different projects in cybersecurity, computer networks, and IoT.

I am part of the [Cybersecurity and Ciberphysical Systems Research Group (SciFi)](https://scifi-IFRS.github.io) at IFRS and [Systems Reliability and Security Research Group (CONSEG)](https://conseg.github.io/) at PUCRS.
